Description:
-------------
The md5 Checksum Checker Python API is a Python library that allows you to calculate the MD5 checksum of a file. It provides a simple and efficient way to verify the integrity of files by comparing their checksums. This library is implemented in pure Python and does not require any external dependencies.

Usage Instructions:
-------------------
1. Make sure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from the official Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. Download the md5 Checksum Checker Python API library files.

3. Import the `calculate_md5` function from the library into your Python script.

4. Call the `calculate_md5` function, providing the file path as an argument, to calculate the MD5 checksum.

Example Usage:
--------------
```python
from md5_checksum import calculate_md5

file_path = "path/to/your/file"
md5_checksum = calculate_md5(file_path)
print("MD5 Checksum:", md5_checksum)```

Running the Program:
--------------------
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Save the Python script containing the example usage provided above.
3. Replace "path/to/your/file" with the actual path to the file for which you want to calculate the MD5 checksum.
4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the Python script is saved.
5. Run the script using the command: python script_name.py, where script_name.py is the name of the Python script file.

Use Case:
---------
The md5 Checksum Checker Python API can be used in various scenarios, including:

* Verifying the integrity of downloaded files to ensure they were not corrupted during transfer.
* Detecting file tampering or unauthorized modifications.
* Comparing checksums of files before and after specific operations to check for changes.
* Implementing file validation mechanisms in software applications.
